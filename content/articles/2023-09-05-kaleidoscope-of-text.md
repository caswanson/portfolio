Users scan, not read, web pages. Surfing the web is often a hurried, almost frantic search process that results in users primarily searching for key phrases and words instead of ingesting a whole page’s text. To maximize your user’s attention, Steve Krug in _Don’t Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web and Mobile Usability_ outlines six different guidelines:

- Take advantage of conventions
- Create effective visual hierarchies
- Break pages up into clearly defined areas
- Make it obvious what’s clickable
- Eliminate distractions
- Format content to support scanning

I believe Kaleidoscope, a scholarship and grant management software site, does an excellent and aesthetically-pleasing job of making the most of user’s attention. There are many small details I love about the site and design features that make it beautiful to look at, but I think the site does a particularly nice job of eliminating distractions to center the user’s the most pertinent information first. When you first navigate to the page, a large, six-word tagline appears front and center in the page with a longer sentence sub-heading it inviting the user to join their software. Two contrasting buttons sit below this text, and this is all the page contains. Only when a user scrolls down and then up again does a bar show up on the top presenting the user with many more navigation choices. This information can be obscured when a user first visits a site because Kaleidoscope is delivering the most basic information about what they do first. The user isn’t distracted by too many choices right off the bat.

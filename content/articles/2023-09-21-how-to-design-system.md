1. Build a Typographic Scale

A typographic scale is a series of font sizes and line heights: essentially everything having to do with the spacing and sizing of your text. Usually, the most basic typographic scale is composed of a title, header, body, subtitle, and button size, or h1-h6. Make sure to take into account strong (bold) and emphasized (italic) styles in your typographic scales. You can use the golden ratio to define the different font sizes. Lastly, consider the spacing that you want between the letters in the different sizes of your font. Make sure to include instructions on proper use of your typographic scale to ensure that designers and engineers alike are utilizing the overall design system correctly.

2. Create a Color Scheme

To create a color scheme, always communicate with your design team when developing this part of your design system. Designate a primary, secondary, and accent color, and start minimally. Establish your core colors before expanding. Give your colors memorable and on-brand names to use across your designs. If you are starting from scratch, you can utilize apps to generate color schemes. If you want to expand, consider a dark mode color scheme!

To build a full-fledged design system, youâ€™ll want to add a library of components among many other things, but this is an excellent start! Happy designing!

"Prudence"

In Krug's book, _Don't Make Me Think_, he primarily writes on web usability but he specifically drills down on accesibility in one chapter. He asserts that making a site more acessible automatically makes it more usable. Aside from the first and foremost reason for designing for accessibility on the web (it's the right thing to do), Krug cites this reason as an argument for it. He writes that making sites more usable for the general able-bodied population is one of the best ways to make a site more usable for disabled populations. It is prudent to first fix the usability issues that bother everyone in order to make it more accessible. Using a site with a disability only exacerbates usability issues already present. Not only will fixing the most common usability issues benefit the population without a disability, it will increase the site's accessibility greatly! When designers and developers are pressed for time, this strategy is a prudent and wise way to increase both usability and accessibility at the same time.

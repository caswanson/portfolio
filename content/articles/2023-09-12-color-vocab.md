I found that all of the color terms can easily blend together and become meaningless. This concept map/flow chart depicts the relationships between the vocabularly terms that describe color and color tones. I believe these concepts are important to keep in mind in my career because when working with designers, it is necessary to understand the terms and concepts they are talking about related to color. On the flipside, it is important to know these concepts so that as a software engineer I can communicate my color vision to a designer.

I recently participated in a design accessibility workshop modeled like a UN Summit, with students each representing different populations to keep in mind when creating inclusive designs. The representatives advocated for their population and certain design features that their population would benefit from, such as image alt-text for blind people. The reps discussed with one another and worked to convince others that their design features should be given a higher priority than others on the proposal document. Coalitions were formed between certain representatives when their population’s needs aligned.

I was representing non-native speakers. I learned that non-native speakers benefit from standard interface language (ex: making trash/delete one uniform term), no overly clever language, and icons accompanying text. The topic discussed at the summit was the accessibility of the Sarpy County early ballot request site. All representatives were proposing changes to this site based on their population’s needs. I suggested that non-native speakers would benefit from simplified copy to increase readability, icons expressing early ballot availability (x for none available, prompts to action for other options), and fully localized page view options translated by native speakers.

During the summit, I fought hardest for fully localized pages translated by native speakers. This was the hardest proposal to convince others of its importance because no other populations benefit from this feature besides the one I was representing. It was much easier to find allies for adding icons because other representatives, such as the ones representing dyslexia and baby boomers, were also pushing for this requirement. One unlikely ally was the rep for baby boomers, Han, who agreed that the copy needed to be simpler for older populations. Overall, it was hardest to convince the rural representative, Sarah, that non-native speakers required fully translated pages more than users needed faster loading speeds. However, it felt somewhat wrong to objectively argue that some populations needed their needs met more than other populations, though I think at the conclusion of the summit fair compromises were made.

An overall tactic I noticed was successful when trying to convince other reps to move my proposal to a higher priority was selling them on how the proposal would benefit their population as well. I think it’s helpful to explain to others the value they will get from an action when persuading others to do something for you. People in general like to know what’s “in it” for them. As far as accessibility goes, I learned a great deal about how to design more inclusively for other populations on the web. I spent a large portion of time discussing with the rural rep during the summit, and I learned about what that population needs. I didn’t realize how important keeping fast loading speeds in mind when designing was so important until hearing from the rep. It will be helpful to remember this the next time I’m designing or building a web application. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the UIUN Summit because I was able to learn in detail about the needs of many web users.

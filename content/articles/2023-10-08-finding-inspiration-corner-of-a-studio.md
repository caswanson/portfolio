![Corner of a Studio art piece](/images/corner-of-a-studio.jpg)

While visiting the Nelson Atkins Art Museum in Kansas City this weekend I was struck by one piece that inspired me by its cheerful, bright color scheme and serene mood. The painting was entitled “Corner of Studio” and was painted by Jane Freilicher in 1973. Freilicher loved to paint scenes from her homes in urban and rural New York.

**Perspective**

The framing of this painting is so unique because the viewer is taken inside a studio yet the painting leads your focus beyond the window to outside the studio. It evokes a cozy feeling of being inside and comfortable but also a feeling of peace and serenity upon looking out at the calm and bright sweeping landscape. Freilicher uses a linear perspective in this painting and although there isn’t a single vanishing point in this painting, she still makes use of multiple vertical lines to create a 3D space.

**Emotive Colors**

Although green dominates the color scheme, the light pinks/oranges bring more warmth to the painting. The vivid, pastel-toned colors evoke cheeriness and bright tranquility. Further, the more saturated a color is the more amplified the color’s emotions are. Therefore, since the greens are particularly saturated in this picture, the peace that the green evokes is only amplified by its saturation.

**Rule of Thirds**

Freilicher uses the rule of thirds and an unique view point to add dimension and interest to the scene. Instead of simply framing the painting to look directly out of the window, she uses the bottom corner and right side of the painting to include a bit of a view of a studio to add depth. The rule of thirds is a common principle in design and is used in all mediums — painting, photography, and even interior design. One can see that the Freilicher’s studio windows even use the rule of thirds — they are divided into 3 even sections.

Taking inspiration from “Corner of Studio”, I designed a quick mock up of a mobile app for caretakers to track baby’s activities throughout the day while the guardian/parent is away. The babysitter or person in charge of childcare can input activity throughout the day to keep the parent updated, such as nap length or what they had for lunch. There is even a “journal” feature where users can input cute or silly things about the baby that they want to record for the parents/guardian to see later.

Something about the painting’s bright colors made me want to design something baby-related. The playful colors seemed bright and stimulating enough for a mobile app with good enough contrast but pastel enough to work with a soft “baby” theme. In the final version of the app, there would be lots of color — those similar to the colors in “Corner of Studio”.

I loved discovering and gathering inspiration from “Corner of Studio”. Through my research on perspective, I learned some interesting details about the historical use of perspective in different cultures. For example, the way the ancient Egyptians used perspective/depth in their art was very different than the way European artists used it during the Renaissance.

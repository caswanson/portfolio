In _Don't Make Me Think_, tabs are praised for providing clear navigation to all types of users. The author cites reasons such as their appeal to computer-illiterate users, their obviousness, and their slickness. However, I disagreed with his claim that tabs are "slick" looking, at least in the sense that he described them. He asserted that in order for tabs to "work" as proper navigation, the active tab needs to feel like it's in front of the other tabs. I felt that I had not seen a modern and clean example of this until I went on Zapier's site. Their combo of shading the selected section as a button and highlighting the bottom of the section does give the feel of a "real life" tab in a pleasing way. In addition to this, the arrow points up when that section is selected. All of these small details combined create a clear, visually appealing, and life-like tab navigation structure.

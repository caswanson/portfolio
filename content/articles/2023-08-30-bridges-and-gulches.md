“The Bridge of Evaluation is to The Bridge of Execution as preparing to wave your hands under a sink with no handles is to moving your hands higher up under the sink to potentially trigger the motion sensor.”

While this analogy might seem a bit stretched, I believe it applies the principles of the bridges of evaluation and execution correctly. In _The Design of Everyday Things_, Don Norman defines the Bridge of Evaluation as the series of steps which guides a user over the Gulf of Evaluation, where a user tries to figure out how to use a product. The Bridge of Evaluation consists of planning, specifying, and performing. The Bridge of Execution helps a user cross the Gulf of Execution, in which they try to figure out what happened with the thing they just tried to use. The Bridge of Execution consists of perceiving, interpreting, and comparing. In the scenario of a user trying to wash their hands in an automatic sink, they first come upon the Gulf of Evaluation. They (usually subconsciously) evaluate and plan how they are going to approach the sink and clean their hands. They notice that there are no handles near the faucet and plan to proceed as if it is an automatic sink, as their conceptual model of an automatic sink is a sink with no handles. Now, they have crossed the Bridge of Evaluation. Next, they stand upon the Gulf of Execution. They cross the gulf by noticing that when they place their hands where they believe the automatic sensor should be, nothing comes out of the faucet. Let’s say, in this scenario, they perceive this and evaluate once again and move their hands a bit higher, thinking perhaps that is where the motion sensor is. Now, the user is on the other side of the bank and has crossed the Bridge of Execution.

I believe the principles of the gulfs and bridges are important ones to remember when designing things to have easy discoverability. In anything I design, I want the Gulf of Execution to be small, and I want users to feel confident they know how to use the product the correct way the first time they execute, instead of needing to pivot after attempting to user it in one certain way they believe to be right. In my future career, I want to never forget to look at products/interfaces I design with the eyes of a beginner and create a low user barrier to entry in my design.

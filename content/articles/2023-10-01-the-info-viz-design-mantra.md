Ben Schneiderman, the "father" of info visualization, coined the phrase "overview first, zoom-and-filter, then details-on-demand" when describing the optimal way to digitally display information. The flow starts with overview: Schneiderman says users should be able to "gain an overview of the entire collection" in his publication, _The Eyes Have It: A Task by Data Type Taxonomy for Information Visualizations_. When overviewing, viewers should see every entry and possibly an aiding detail for that entry. Next, users should be able to zoom and filter through the entire collection to quickly narrow their search for the information they want through buttons, sliders, and more. Advanced filtering usually includes letting users input boolean statements, including AND or OR operators. Finally, details-on-demand. In this step, users should be able to obtain information about an item or group quickly, often shown in a popup. Further operations inside this step include relating, which lets user view relationships between items. Users may also view a history of their searches, as their first search usually doesn't yield their desired results. Lastly, users may be able to extract information and export information to other apps or file forms.

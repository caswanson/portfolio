"Informed-ness"

While researching the best ways to prepare for a UI/UX design interview and the ways in which employers assess potential design employees, I was surprised to find a large theme of "informed-ness" or being "in the know". Multiple sample interview questions related to asking the interviewee how they kept up with current design trends, either by asking them their current favorite or what sources they read design news from. I was surprised to learn that being informed about trends played such a big role in the evaluation process of an applicant. Obviously a desire to learn is beneficial to anyone applying for jobs -- especially in tech -- but in design there is another aspect of learning in which an applicant needs to be "in the know" about what's cool in design as of late. Design is a unique industry in which innovations and the "newest thing" are almost exclusively -- it's not as if you can obviously tell if a website is using the newest and best React framework by simply viewing it, like you can in design. With this theme in mind, I have been inspired to do more independent research and form more opinions on what's trending in design, not to be swept up in fads, but merely to stay "in the know" about the current state of the industry.

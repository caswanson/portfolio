In _Don't Make Me Think_, Steve Krug outs university websites as being terrible examples of web home pages designed by stakeholders. He claims that often every stakeholder has input on what should be on the home screen, resulting in an over-crowded mix of content that is ultimately irrelevant to the average user. He points out that often university website home pages contain features of alumni in the news, press releases, or a letter from the president while users actually want to find application forms, parking info, or a list of faculty contact info. I decided to take a look at UNL's home page to analyze if the University utilizes good home screen design principles.

The primary content on the home screen is a featured student and corresponding story -- not overly useful to most visitors to the site. Aside from this taking most of the attention of the home screen, UNL does include multiple useful buttons and links, such as a prominent button to explore admissions, as well as an easily accessible "apply" button in the top navigation bar. Overall, I assume an average student or user would be able to find the item they were looking for on the site, but I believe most of the prime real estate on the page could be put to better use. GBR and remember to carefully and intentionally craft your site's home page!

Throughout the process of making my portfolio, I aimed to make every component of it clean and minimal. This extended to navigation as well. I organized my portfolio up into three main sections: home (which includes an intro and info about me), articles (which includes all of my blog posts, including original work and things I've studied), and portfolio (which includes my polished finalized works). I've also organized an intuitive way to navigate through the "articles" section by providing an always-open scrollable sidebar which displays all of the articles.

To align with my "clean" aesthetic, most of the site colors are neutral in order to let the few emojis and blog post pictures pop. The "normal" site is primarly white with light gray and black accents. However, there is a dark mode, mostly for fun, but also to accomodate for different lighting situations. The dark mode primarily features navy with slate gray and white accents.

My portfolio also includes a harmonious balance of affordances and signifiers. All of the buttons navigating to the different parts of the site highlight on hover, signifying that they are clickable. Further, in the article view sidebar the selected article is highlighted a dark color, signifying that that is the article the reader is currently on.

I also paid special attention to making my portfolio accessible and easy to use for all. All of the images featured on the site have alt text describing the pictures to those who use screen readers or cannot load the images. As mentioned earlier, my portfolio also supports dark mode, which allows for a better viewing experience to those in darker environments or who prefer a lower contrast view.

In an effort to make my portfolio easy to digest and minimal, the portfolio view showcases a snapshot of text describing each project and key words and phrases are highlighted on the homepage. For example, on the landing page of the site that contains info about me, my interests and strengths are bolded. I also use a few emojis througout this page to quickly allow the user to infer meaning of phrases without necessarily having to read the entire sentence.

I also incorporate a growth perspective in my portfolio, namely through my specific portfolio page. I include early-stage sketches and mockups of my showcase project, MVP, to show where I started and where I am now. I also organize all of my articles chronologically, so a viewer can see how I have grown through time. Lastly, I am sure to emphasize that I love learning and growing my skillset in my about me section on my homepage.

In all of the content that I quote, reference, or take inspiration from others I am sure to provide proper attribution to them. In most of my articles this takes the form of links to the book I reference. In other works, such as my "Finding Inspiration" study, I provide citations for the artwork and design ideas I reference. This attribution can also look like mentioning (either by name or anonymously) classmates or colleagues who have provided valuable feedback on my various works.

As I've previously mentioned, I have intentionally tried to weave the value of "cleanliness" into my site's navigation, design, and copy. I have done this through neutral colors, simple navigation, and short and sweet copy. Throughout all of this, I've woven my second value of "excellence" into everything. From adding a unique browser icon to ensuring all of my citation links are properly formatted, I have done my best to pay special attention to crafting excellence in the details. On a not-so-subtle level, I also explicity mention these two values as being passions of mine on my about me homepage.

_Color Harmony_ speaks lengthily about the psychology of color and what emotions each color evokes or stands for. For this free-form blog post, I am performing a color anlysis according to _Color Harmony_'s description of each color on a picutre I took of a rug in Boulder, Colorado.

First, the rug contains primarily earthy tones, and combined with the dirt-brown color of my boots illicits feelings of honest living and eco-friendliness. The orange in the rug is the most striking feature and hue. It once again has an earthy undertone and reminds the viewer of terra cotta and fall leaves. Orange signifies adventure and playfulness as well. The light blue cools down the rug -- it's constant and dependable serenity contrasts against the slightly more bold colors of the rest of the rug. The third notable color present in the rug is the striking black highlights. Since most of the rug is comprised of lighter hues, the black greatly stands out! Black is timeless and can be suspicious and sophisticated at the same time. I believe in this rug's context, black anchors the rug and exudes purpose and strength. Lastly, the pleasant pale green color that wraps the outer edge of the rug reminds the viewer of peace, growth, and nature.

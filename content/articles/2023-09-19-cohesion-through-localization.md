“Cohesion”

I am a big fan of uniformity. I love order and precision — nothing bothers me more than an irregularly capitalized Google Docs title or an oddly spaced document. In Figma’s publication _Design Systems_, a variety of authors write about the importance of design standardization and common practices for making a brand style guide. I particularly enjoyed their article on standardizing product content for a cohesive and pleasurable user experience. Discrepancies between title and sentence case in headings and lines of text can cause small irregularities leading to an uneasy and disjointed experience. The level of cohesion between text is a large factor in my mind for how professional a site appears. Localization is an increasingly important topic that I want to learn more about to utilize in my career. I’ve gotten to do a bit of localization work in the past, and I believe keeping localization in mind provides a special sense of wholistic cohesion throughout the site no matter. No matter where you are in the world, a site that keeps localization at the forefront functions and looks the same, even though it is precisely tailored for that geographical region. I would love to work internationally in the future, but even if I don’t have the opportunity to, I want to keep cohesion and excellence in mind throughout all the work I produce.

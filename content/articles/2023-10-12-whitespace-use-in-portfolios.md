"Sparse"

As I scrolled through the many beautiful sample UX portfolios in [this](https://blog.uxfol.io/ux-portfolio-examples/) article by UXFolio, I noticed that they all were extremely sparse, but they all pulled it off well. This concept was even mentioned in the article too -- the writer encourages those who are afraid of their portfolio looking too bare to go ahead and use more whitespace than they think. The result (if done correctly), is a sophisticated and clean look that lends itself well to any personal aesthetic. In my future design endeavors (especially for designing my personal portfolio), I think it will be key to remember that using text and images sparsely can lead to a very professional-looking end result. Obviously minimalisim is especially popular currently, but I believe that simplicity will always be timeless. I was very inspired by UXFolio's post and am quite looking forward to using liberal whitespace in my portfolio and next design projects.

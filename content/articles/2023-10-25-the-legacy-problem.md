"Legacy"

Many usability issues stem from what designers call "the legacy problem" -- which is the idea that a product is released with certain standards/design features, and every generation or iteration of that product has the same standards, even if they are not user-friendly. Many design issues persist because of this principle. "The way things are always done" often trumps innovation or new ideas. In an effort to stomp out the legacy problem, designers must constantly be re-evaluating the "status quo" and questioning standards that are just there because they are "standard". In order to make elegant, user-friendly products, designers must keep the legacy problem at the forefront of their mind.

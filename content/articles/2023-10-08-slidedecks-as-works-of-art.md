It’s often so difficult to break out of the box of the ordinary, especially when it comes to presentations. It’s easy to resort back to the same old Google Slides templates (maybe a Slides Go template if you’re fancy) and list a couple bullet points on each page and call it good. However, delivering information through any medium, especially visual presentations, is a creative process which demands innovation. Creating a slide deck for any type of occasion is a creative act. One must be artistic in their organization and design of the information being presented. We must force ourselves to not be constrained to the rhythms of slideshow design but instead think outside of the box while still keeping our message succinct. This example slide deck does a nice job of taking a more creative approach to slide design. If you look at the slides, you wouldn’t instantly know they were slides — they could be any piece of digital art. These are a prime example of innovating and designing mundane things we get used to — such as slideshows — in a creative way.

Figma is a tool only growing in prevelance in the design world, so it pays to know the application and it's handy shortcuts inside out to stay on the cutting egde! In this post, I've complied some helpful and sometimes obsure tips for prototyping in Figma.

**It All Starts With Components**

- After making a group of objects a component, if you change the "master" component, then all the instances of your component will be edited
- Shortcut to create a component: Command + Shift + K

**Common, Useful Tools**

- Code tab on the right provides styling code for components
- Auto layout resizes components automatically if they are edited, ex: pill box button will resize if button text is edited
- Right click, navigate to "Arrange" --> "Tidy Up", and your elements will be automatically arranged into an orderly structure
- Boolean groups allow you to select different variations of multiple objects, ex: union, intersection
- Slice tool allows you to take a cropped slice of your design and export it easily

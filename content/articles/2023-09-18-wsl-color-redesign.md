The World Surfing League (WSL) is the equivalent to the NFL for football or the MLS for American soccer. In an experimental exercise, I redesigned WSL’s site with different featured colors. Each has a unique mood and overall feel. Continue reading for snippets of these redesigned sites and analyses on which is the most effective.

The site’s original color combination of dark blue and hints of yellow, along with the base colors of black and white, evoke a serious feeling but not a solemn one. The combination is sporty and doesn’t take itself too seriously, while still not being airy or whimsical. Since blue and yellow are both primary colors, the two combined are somewhat playful. Overall, they give the site a professional look while still having a hint of the laid-back vibe of the surfing community.

This iteration of the site’s colors evokes a much more autumnal, cozy, and minimal feel. Since the top bar is a lighter color than the original, the site feels more airy and less dark and closed off than the original. The shades of orange/red provide a sophisticated feel to the site while still keeping it warm and welcoming. This color combo works well because most of the colors on the page are all shades of the same hue — orange-ish red. Lastly, the warm tones in the site’s header contrast nicely with the large swath of blue ocean in the featured picture, as orange and blue are complementary colors.

This version of the site features once again shades of one hue – blue. As a calming color, the differing shades of blue provide a serene feel to the site while still keeping it interesting with lighter and darker versions of blue. Since most of the site’s background is white, this is the airiest and brightest-feeling version of the site. Using exclusively blue brings the viewer’s mind to the water and the ocean, which ties in well with the cover image.

This muted color combo is very understated and not in your face. Even though there are two technically “cool” colors present, the site evokes an earthy, toned-down, and warm feeling. The colors are darker but not all-encompassing. The site feels quieter and less energetic than the original. Purple and green are just one off from being complementary colors, so the combination results in a slightly less contrasting look than if the two colors were true complements. Though the site feels put-together and professional, the color scheme is probably not fitting for a sports site, which usually demands more energy and _punch_.

Although each redesign has new aspects it brings to WSL’s website experience, I believe one is more effective than the others. The most “effective” color scheme, in this case, means the color scheme that aligns most with WSL’s brand and values. I believe that the all-blue-hued site(#2) best encapsulates WSL’s brand. The colors remind the viewer of water and provide a “chill” website experience for a “chill” sport. Although WSL’s current site incorporates some blue from their logo, the large blocks of black and highlights of yellow are too stark and end up creating an enclosed feeling on the site. Overall, I believe color scheme #2 provides an excellent mix of professionalism combined with a laid-back feel.

Surf’s up!

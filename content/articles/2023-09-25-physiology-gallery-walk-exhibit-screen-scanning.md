![Screen scanning exhibit](/images/screen-scanning.jpg)

Pictured is an exhibit on screen scanning patterns I contributed to a collaborative art and physiology gallery walk exhibit. Throughout the process of compliling my exhibit I was able to dive into copy conventions and how humans scan text on screens. Enjoy scanning the exhibit! ðŸ˜Š

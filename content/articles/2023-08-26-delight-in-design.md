“Delight”

Don Norman asserts in _The Design of Everyday Things_ that “[g]reat designers produce pleasurable experiences”. However, the overall “experience” a product provides is often neglected in an engineering point of view. As the reading points out, experience “determines how fondly people remember their interactions [with a certain interface]”. Although a product’s “experience” can seem like a less important component than its “function” or “features”, I believe (and the reading asserts) that they are equal. I chose the word “delight” to summarize the book’s section on experience because I believe it captures the euphoric, joyful feeling one gets when one has a satisfying or smooth experience with an interface. In my career, I want to continually ask myself if the experience I’m crafting will bring delight to the user — even if what I’m working on is something as simple and nondescript as an internal tool for my co-workers.

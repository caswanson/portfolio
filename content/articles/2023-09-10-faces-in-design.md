Humans are naturally drawn to faces. We spot them where there are none, and our eyes are subconciously drawn to them in visual media. Along with being drawn to faces in images, our eyes are drawn to where the human face is looking. Therefore, it is important to position faces in a way that draws the viewer's eyes to places we want them to look. In the sample slide that I've sketched below, I'm combining the use of empty space, the rule of thirds, and human fixation on faces to emphasize the text in the middle of the slide. The contrast of the white background and the photograph also provides a focal point for the slide. The sketch is an imaginary kombucha ad meant to grab the viewer's attention quickly.

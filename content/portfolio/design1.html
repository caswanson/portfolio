<h2>Design Evolution Narrative</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to MVP – an intramural sports team management site for everyday recreationalists. I built MVP alone and was inspired by my past poor interactions with intramural sites. As a player on multiple intramural teams during my time in college, I had interacted with the software that my university uses quite a bit to register for teams, rsvp to games, and see match outcomes. I don’t consider myself a sports enthusiast, but I love being active and playing team sports with friends to build community. I found myself caught up in frustrating workflows and unclear directions on my university’s intramural sports site and wanted to spend more time playing at the rec than navigating a poorly-designed website. I designed MVP simply to make student’s intramural sports experience as painless and fun as possible and return time back to them so they can spend more time playing and building community.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I chose to design MVP first and foremost for the web, as it is the medium through which students will most often interact with the software. Modern college students do most of their work on laptops and are often on their computers throughout the school day. Users of MVP will most likely check game times and field messages from opposing team captains throughout their school day before their intramural games at night. Designing MVP for the web will make it easy for students to flip between answering a new chat on MVP right back to their paper on Google Docs. Providing users with easy and quick access to the site will increase their willingness to use it.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    In the beginning stages of the design process, I wrote a narrative revolving around the character Piper to inspire MVP’s design. Piper is a college student at the University of Colorado-Boulder who loves being active and organization. She coordinates all of the intramural sports teams her local church college group put together. In the narrative, Piper is on a train trip with fellow intramural team players to see one of their favorite bands in concert in Utah. On the trip, she is working on homework when she receives an email reminding her of her team’s upcoming intramural soccer game, which she realizes they will be out of town for. Quickly logging in to MVP, she visits her team’s page and chats the opposing soccer team’s captain, requesting a time change for the upcoming game. Piper’s stress dissipates once she realizes the game will be able to be easily rescheduled and she can enjoy the rest of the train ride to Utah.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    I designed MVP to be bold and easy to quickly navigate, as often users will be navigating through the site fast between homework breaks or to quickly view a game time and then close out of the site. Piper benefits from this feature on her train ride as she (mildly panicked-ly) contacts her opposing team captain to sort the game time out. I also designed MVP to allow users to directly request a game time change through MVP as I heard this was a common pain point experienced by intramural site users through my user interviews. Again, Piper utilizes this feature in her rush to change the game time in MVP. Other intramural sites require both team captains to physically visit the intramural office and agree on a new game time.

    After user interviews, narrative writing, sketching, and mockups, I moved onto creating a cohesive design system to capture MVP’s core values: community and fun. I chose a clean sans-serif body font and a blockier display font for the MVP logo. I felt that the display font I chose echoed blocky jersey lettering while adding a modern twist. Initially, I chose shades of orange for the primary and secondary colors of the site because I felt that orange was a bright and “fun” color, tying back to MVP’s core value. However, I always envisioned MVP using a bright violet blue so I switched to shades of royal/violet blue. I felt that the brightness of the blue still brought an element of “fun” to the design but the cool tone calmed the site down a bit. For some reason, I love designing badges, and I wanted “pending” players who had not yet accepted their invitation to join an intramural team on MVP to have a striking badge. I chose to contrast two shades of blue against one another (violet blue and timberwolf) to make the badge stand out, rather than using white for one of the colors in the badge.

<h4>Design System</h4>

    In this first prototype of MVP, a user is expected to login and would be greeted with their dashboard overviewing the various teams they are in charge of and their upcoming games. They would then navigate to the team they want to view by clicking on the team name, and would be taken to their team page, outlining upcoming games and displaying the roster as well as season stats. Next, they would click on the only game under “upcoming games” to be taken to the game page. Here, a user could do multiple actions, including viewing an opponent’s season stats or chatting the opposing team’s captain directly, but the focused feature in the prototype is requesting a time change for the game. In this view, a user would select a new date and time, add a message to the opponent, and submit the time change request.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Next, the prototype was reviewed by a colleague through a mock user test. Since this was one of the first times getting my design in front of real potential users other than me, it opened my eyes to many things that were “obvious” to me. I learned that some components that were intended to be clickable were not obviously clickable to a new user. I also received many suggestions on potential features MVP could support. My colleague who reviewed my design had prior experience with an intramural sports management site and was able to offer me valuable suggestions about what features I could implement next. He looked for a place to view individual game stats on the site (as opposed to entire-season stats) and suggested I could add that feature. He also requested an option to view future games (specifically playoffs) in a bracket format. From this experience, I learned that the prototype was strong at signifying what actions a user could take on a given page (ex: view opponent stats button was obvious on game page), but weak at guiding a user’s actions through more subtle signifiers (ex: hover states). Most of my changes after the colleague assessment revolved around the weaknesses I discovered and the suggested features my colleague highlighted. I added hover states to many clickable list items and added a “view game stats” button option alongside viewing season stats, as my colleague suggested. I also added a button to invite players to teams directly on the dashboard in the “pending invites” box, as my colleague was confused on how to invite players directly from the dashboard.

    After my colleague's assessment, I conducted official user tests. The users who tested MVP were real intramural team captains who had experience with intramural team management software. One of the users who tested the site was her sorority’s intramural chair, tasked with registering and managing 3+ intramural teams per season. In each user test, I guided the user through a series of intros and explanations on what to expect during the test. I asked for their honest feedback and for them to think out loud, assuring them my feelings wouldn’t be hurt by their criticism. After briefing them on MVP’s overarching purpose and their imaginary role in the testing scenario,I had each user complete two tasks in their test: 1) Inviting a player to an existing intramural soccer team they are the captain of, and 2) Requesting a time change and sending a message to the opposing team captain of their soonest intramural game. Each user test was brief, and I concluded by asking them if they had any general comments or questions about the site.
</p>
<br>
<p>
    During my user testing, I primarily found overarching workflow issues on the site as well as small details that were confusing to users. Many times, I realized I left users stranded on certain pages with no sufficient “back” navigation. I also utilized confusing icons and organization conventions at times, specifically in the roster view. I committed to making multiple changes after the user tests. The first was providing feedback that a user had successfully requested a time change, because users were unsure that they had actually successfully submitted a request and had no way to ensure they did. I added an indicator below the scheduled game time that a time change request had been made after they had submitted one. Secondly, I added a small dot icon on the calendar view to indicate when a team had upcoming games because users didn’t want to have to click on every individual day to view whether their team had a game that day or not. Adding small icons gave them a more comprehensive overview first. Thirdly, I added components to give the login page a more polished feel, such as a “remember me” checkbox and a “forgot password” option. Adding these small details increased the prototype’s professionalism and also will enrich a potential user’s experience logging in. Fourth, I added multiple minimal back buttons to increase user’s confidence in navigating the site and provide them with a way to recoup navigation mistakes quickly. Lastly, I changed the wording on the team page above the calendar view from “This week…” to “Today…” to help the user more quickly find where upcoming games are located and more accurately represent what the calendar view is displaying. Providing clear messaging increases a user’s efficiency on a site and therefore increases their satisfaction with the site.

<p>
    Overall, my aim in designing MVP was to bring users a sense of community and fun when interacting with the site. These are the interface’s two core values, as I’ve mentioned before. The bright colors and playful icons bring fun into the interface. Features such as directly chatting opponents and an always-there view of the roster help foster community through sports. Sports bring people together in fun and light-hearted ways, and I hope MVP can play a small part in someone’s story in making that happen.

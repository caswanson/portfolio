# Hello ðŸ‘‹

**Welcome to my portfolio!**

I'm Carina! I'm a developer and design enthusiast. My interests lie in **excellent, clean design** and the **intersection of tech and non-profit work**. I have development experience at multiple nonprofits, most notably at Love Justice International, where I designed and developed a mobile app in React Native to aid in the organization's anti-trafficking efforts. I love innovating and learning new tech stacks and design methodologies.

I'm an avid kombucha drinker, concert-goer, and outdoors-lover. I'd love to connect with you!

Say hello ðŸ’¬, drop me a link to what you're loving right now ðŸ’¡, or poke around my portfolio ðŸ’«!
